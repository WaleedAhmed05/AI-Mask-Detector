# AI-Mask-Detector using deep learning Convolutional neural network
Project COMP6721 - Applied Artificial Intelligence @ Concordia University 

AI Mast Detector can analyze face images and detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, the type of mask that is being worn, and whether the mask is worn correctly. This model is trained on dataset of 2000 portraits, 1500 for training and 500 for testing. This model has accuracy of 95% with 97% F1-score.
